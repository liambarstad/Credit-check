The learner archetype is one that resonates with me, putting the pursuit of
knowledge before all else. Focus, analytical, and deliberative are hence describing
the same thought process, my thought process, which involves dissecting problems
methodically into smaller and smaller parts. In essence, the plan is the most important
part. The command strength emphasizes my tendency to approach problems head on,
rather than attempting an easier route another way. To me, if a more intuitive route
can be established, the extra effort will be worth it. However, I often have problems
following instructions, as I think that approaching the situation in my own way
will have a more effective outcome. As a result, I either end up coming up with my
own solution, or misinterpreting some purpose of the task and having to re-do parts
of it. This is both a blessing and a curse. For example, instead of completing this
response in bulleted form to specifically answer every question posed in the reflection
template, I instead chose to write a free form paragraph because the answers started
to bleed into each other.
